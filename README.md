# SVG Logo Maker

## Description
This project I was tasked with creating a command-line application that dynamically generates a .svg logo file from a user's input using Node.JS & Inquirer.JS. Please read the below user story, usage instructions, and view the demo videos linked below to learn more about this application.


## User Story

AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer


## Usage

To use this application: 
<ul>
<li> Please open a terminal that is compatible with Inquirer.js (this can either be the integrated Mac OS Terminal application or the in-line terminal built into Visual Studio Code.)</li>
<li> Once open, please cd to the directory where index.js is located and run <b>node index.js</b>.</li>
<li> Once the function is run w/in your terminal application, a series of prompts & questions should appear.</li>
<li> Starting with the first prompt ("Please enter 3 characters as your logo's text"), please input and/or select the desired text, text color, shape and shape color for your logo file.</li>
<li> After providing a response to all questions/prompts, your newly generated svg logo file will be save to your directory.</li>
</ul>
